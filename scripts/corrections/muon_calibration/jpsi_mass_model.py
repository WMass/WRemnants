"""Mixture model + θ-conditioned flow for the unbinned J/ψ mass calibration.

Forward-folding design (both nuisances applied to MC, flow conditioned on
both; the θ gradients flow only through the flow's conditioning input):

* ``theta_scale`` ∈ R^{24×3}  — per-η-bin (A, e, M) muon scale nuisances.
* ``theta_smear`` ∈ R^{24×2}  — per-η-bin (a, c) muon smearing nuisances,
  ``σ²_qop_i = a²_{b_i} + c²_{b_i} · k²_i``.

The flow is a conditional density ``p(m | y, θ_scale_pm, σ_qop_pm)``.

MC branch (trains the flow's θ-dependence — NO θ gradient):
  Sample θ̃_scale ~ N(θ_scale.detach(), σ_scale²) and θ̃_smear ~
  N(θ_smear.detach(), σ_smear²) [σ from Adam's 2nd moment, per epoch].
  Apply BOTH transforms to the MC reco momenta at those *detached* sampled
  values — smear (qop Gaussian kernel) then scale (exact T_scale forward,
  or its linearised mass-shift; selected by ``linearize_scale``) — to get
  m_final, and condition the flow on (θ̃_scale_pm, σ_qop_pm). The detach
  means θ never gets a gradient from the transform; the flow simply learns
  how its conditioning maps to the transformed-MC density.

Data branch (fits θ — gradient via the conditioning only):
  The data mass is NOT transformed. The flow is evaluated at the observed
  m_obs, conditioned on the *live* model (θ_scale_pm, σ_qop_pm). The θ
  gradient flows purely through that conditioning input (the flow's learned
  θ-sensitivity), so the fit picks the θ whose transformed-MC template best
  matches the data. Mixed with a degree-1 Bernstein background via the MLP:

  data event:  p(m_obs | y, θ) = f_0(y) p_0 + f_1(y) p_1
                 + (1 − f_0 − f_1) · p_flow(m_obs | y, θ_scale_pm, σ_qop_pm)
  MC event:    p(m_final | y, θ̃) = p_flow(m_final | y, θ̃_scale_pm, σ̃_qop_pm)

``detach_flow_on_data`` (default on) additionally excludes the flow's
parameters from the data-branch gradient, so the template shape is pinned
to MC and the data branch only floats θ and the mixture — removing the
θ_scale ↔ flow-location degeneracy.

# zuko monkey-patch: floor the jacobian before .log() in MonotonicTransform.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# zuko's ``MonotonicTransform.call_and_ladj`` returns ``y, jacobian.log()``.
# For the GF flow's GMM-CDF base, the mathematical jacobian is always
# strictly positive, but it underflows to *exactly* 0 in float32 when the
# input is far from every mixture component — typical at random init.
#  → ``log(0) = -inf`` forward → ``log_p = -inf`` → ``-log p = +inf``
#    poisons the per-batch NLL on the very first batch.
# The backward of ``log(0)`` is also degenerate (``grad_out / 0`` → ±inf
# or NaN), which is the path the anomaly tracer initially reported.
#
# Floor the jacobian at ``1e-30`` before the log: forward becomes finite
# (worst-case ``log(1e-30) ≈ -69``) and the backward is bounded
# (``clamp_min`` gradient is 0 in the clamped region, so the second-order
# autograd through the GF's f-derivative stays clean). Events at the
# clamp boundary contribute zero gradient through this layer — they're
# already in a "no signal" regime where the flow can't tell which way
# to move its mixture, so dropping their gradient is the right behaviour
# anyway; the conditioner network still receives gradient through the
# other (un-clamped) layers.
#
# We additionally clamp the transform INPUT ``x`` before ``self.f(x)``.
# The GF base maps via ``erf(x / √2)``, which in float32 saturates to
# exactly ±1 for ``|x| ≳ 5.7`` — sending the subsequent inverse-CDF / GMM
# map to ±∞ and NaN-ing the backward (the ErfBackward0 → Mul/Exp NaN the
# anomaly tracer reports). ``x`` here is *post-conditioner-affine*, so an
# external mass clamp is not enough: a sharp conditioner (or a pathological
# forward-fold mass) can push ``x`` past the saturation point even for an
# in-window event. Clamping at ±5 (erf(5/√2)=erf(3.54)=0.9999994, finite)
# is well beyond the ~N(0,1) regime the flow maps real events to, so it
# only ever bounds the pathological tail; the jacobian is taken w.r.t. the
# clamped value so the density stays self-consistent there.

        shape, no θ gradient. Data branch: evaluate the flow at the
