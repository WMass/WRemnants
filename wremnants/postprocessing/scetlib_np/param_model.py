"""SCETlibNPParamModel — continuous-λ rabbit ParamModel for SCETlib NP.

This ParamModel scales the signal reco template by a per-bin ratio of the
SCETlib nonperturbative (NP) prediction at the fitted λ vs. at λ_central. The
prediction is built in four steps, written out below; the related modules
(:mod:`response_matrix`, :func:`btgrid_tf.reconstruct_batch`, the validation
scripts) refer here for the derivation.

Pipeline at a glance (everything is a function of the NP parameters λ):

    Step 1   btgrid Hankel + Q integral  →  σ_resum(λ; g)   resummed, on the gen grid
    Step 2   + fixed-order matching      →  σ_gen(λ; g)  = σ_resum(λ; g) + σ_ns(g)
    Step 3   fold through response R      →  σ_reco(λ; b)    gen → reco
    Step 4   ratio vs λ_central          →  rnorm(b, proc)  the shape handed to rabbit

Steps 1–3 build the absolute physical cross section; Step 4 alone produces the
per-bin variation the fit consumes — they are kept separate on purpose.

Indices: Q, Y, qT are the SCETlib btgrid axes (boson mass / rapidity / qT);
g = flattened gen bin (ptVGen, absYVGen); b = flattened reco bin (ptll, yll,
cosThetaStarll_quantile, phiStarll_quantile). λ splits into λ_eff (for F_eff)
and λ_ν (for γ_ν^NP) — the 8 differentiable parameters listed at the end.

=============================================================================
Step 1 — σ_resum(λ; g): the resummed prediction from the bT grid
=============================================================================

(1a) Per-(Q, Y, qT) bT-space (Hankel) integral — the NP parameters enter HERE:

    σ(Q, Y, qT; λ) = qT · ∫ dbT  bT · J₀(qT·bT)
                          · I_pert(Q, Y, qT;  b*(bT))
                          · exp[ C_ν(Q, Y, qT;  bT) · γ_ν^NP(b*(bT); λ_ν) ]
                          · F_eff(Y;  b*(bT); λ_eff)

Where each factor lives — bare bT vs the b*-frozen b̄T:

  bT          bare bT, the Hankel integration variable. Enters ONLY the
              measure factor bT and the Fourier kernel J₀(qT·bT). The leading
              qT· prefactor is SCETlib's x = qT·bT integration convention.
  b*(bT)      the b*-prescription b_star_global(bT), cached as ``b_bar``: bT
              frozen below b_max so the NP factors never reach the Landau pole.
              EVERY NP-carrying factor is evaluated at b*(bT) — I_pert, γ_ν^NP,
              and F_eff — never at bare bT.
  I_pert      perturbative bT-space integrand with NP off. Cached per
              (Q, Y, qT) along the bT axis; λ-independent.
  C_ν         coefficient of γ_ν^NP in the rapidity (CS) log evolution. Cached
              per (Q, Y, qT) AND bT — a full (Nbins, Nbt) array; λ-independent.
              Taken at the BARE bT: the lone NP-exponent factor NOT frozen to
              b* (per the SCETlib convention).
              Because it varies with bT it sits inside the bT integral (not a
              constant out front); because it varies with Q the Q integral
              cannot be collapsed ahead of the fit — the λ-dependence does not
              factor through ∫dQ (exp is nonlinear in C_ν·γ_ν^NP).
  γ_ν^NP      CS-side NP rapidity anomalous dimension; depends on b*(bT) and
              λ_ν only (no Q/Y/qT). λ-dependent.
  F_eff       TMD-effective NP factor; depends on Y² and b*(bT) and λ_eff only
              (no Q/qT). λ-dependent.

Only γ_ν^NP and F_eff carry λ; everything else (bT, J₀, I_pert, C_ν, b*) is
λ-independent and precomputed once — the bT·J₀ kernel, the bT Simpson weights,
and the arctan_Q² Q-integration weights are all built at construction.

The default evaluation uses the memory-factorized layout (deduplicated
(I_pert, C_ν) rows + J₀ kernel on the unique-qT grid + Simpson-as-matmul),
which is numerically equivalent to the per-bin (Nbins, Nbt) layout (≲1e-14
rel., floating-point summation order only) but ~6× smaller — required to fit
a 32 GB GPU. The legacy_recon=1 spec token restores the legacy layout.

(1b) Integrate over Q, then rebin onto the gen grid:

    σ_resum(λ; g) = rebin_{qT→ptVGen, |Y|→absYVGen} [ ∫_{Q_lo}^{Q_hi} dQ  σ(Q, Y, qT; λ) ]

The Q integral uses an arctan_Q² Simpson rule (the x = arctan((Q²−q0²)/(q0·Γ))
transform flattens the Breit-Wigner Z peak). The result (Y, qT) is then rebinned
(Simpson) onto the unfolding hist's gen edges: qT → ptVGen, and the signed btgrid
Y axis folded into |Y| → absYVGen. The |Y| fold is valid because NP is
Y-symmetric (F_eff depends on Y², γ_ν^NP doesn't depend on Y at all).

=============================================================================
Step 2 — σ_gen(λ; g): add the NP-independent fixed-order nonsingular
=============================================================================

    σ_gen(λ; g) = σ_resum(λ; g) + σ_ns(g)

    σ_ns(g)     = rebin_{qT→ptVGen, |Y|→absYVGen} [ σ_DYTurbo^FO − σ_SCETlib-sing^FO ]

The fixed-order matching adds the nonsingular piece σ_ns = (DYTurbo fixed order)
− (SCETlib singular fixed order), read straight from the original FO inputs
(the ``…_nnlo_sing…combined.pkl`` and the DYTurbo ``results_…scetlibmatch.txt``),
Q-windowed to [Q_lo, Q_hi], |Y|-folded, zeroed below qt_cutoff, and summed onto
the (ptVGen, absYVGen) gen bins (see :func:`compute_nonsingular_gen`).

σ_ns is NP-INDEPENDENT (the same for every λ) and is added at GEN level, so it
folds through the same response R as σ_resum in Step 3. Because the fit uses a
ratio (Step 3), σ_ns correctly DILUTES the NP variation where the FO dominates
(high qT). σ_ns is ALWAYS included (it is what the histmaker nominal carries);
for resum-only diagnostics subtract the exposed ``sigma_ns`` from
``sigma_gen_central`` (and re-fold with ``R`` for reco level).

=============================================================================
Step 3 — σ_reco(λ; b): fold gen → reco through the response matrix
=============================================================================

    P(b | g)     = R_raw(b, g) / N_gen(g)               (efficiency × migration)
    σ_reco(λ; b) = Σ_g  P(b | g) · σ_gen(λ; g)

where, in these expressions,
    g = the flattened GEN bin  (ptVGen, absYVGen)   — the grid σ_gen from Steps
        1–2 lives on (boson qT and |Y|), summed over by Σ_g;
    b = the flattened RECO bin (ptll, yll, cosThetaStarll_quantile,
        phiStarll_quantile) — the measured dilepton observables σ_reco lives on.
P(b | g) is the gen→reco mapping (one reco column per gen bin), so σ_reco(λ; b)
is just σ_gen pushed through the detector. The Σ_g is the matvec
``tf.linalg.matvec(self.R, σ_gen_flat)``. This step is pure detector folding —
no λ_central and no ratio enter here; that is Step 4.

Factors (all loaded by :mod:`response_matrix`; see it for the hist mechanics):

  R_raw(b, g)   reco×gen yield from the unfolding histmaker output
                (``nominal_prefsr_yieldsUnfolding``, sample Zmumu): slice
                acceptance=True (gen-fiducial), then project to reco×gen —
                which SUMS the helicitySig axis. R is filled with
                ``nominal_weight_helicity``, a PARTITION of the event weight
                into the 8 helicity pieces that ADD BACK UP, so the physical
                yield is the helicitySig SUM. Units: reco-selected,
                gen-fiducial weighted event counts (already × reco efficiency).
  N_gen(g)      gen-total normalizer: the xnorm ``prefsr`` hist, gen-fiducial
                but BEFORE reco selection. Takes the UL component
                (helicitySig = −1), NOT the sum — N_gen is filled with
                ``csAngularMoments``, a moment expansion whose A_i bins (0..7)
                do NOT sum to σ (some are negative); UL is the
                angular-integrated total.
                ⚠ Same axis as R, OPPOSITE reduction: R is a weight partition
                (SUM helicitySig), N_gen is a moment expansion (take UL).
                Taking UL of R instead would discard the angular partition and
                inflate the closure ~15×.

Why N_gen and not the reco-passing marginal Σ_b R_raw(b, g): R is
post-reco-selection so that marginal already carries efficiency, and dividing
by it cancels efficiency (migration-only) — closes far worse, since efficiency
is strongly gen-dependent (ε ≈ 0.07–0.54 across gen bins on the current file).
N_gen(g) is the true generated total, so P = R_raw/N_gen is the
theory-independent gen→reco map. Pre-FSR: σ_gen, R, and N_gen must all sit at
the same QCD/boson gen level (the postfsr variants in the file close ~1% worse
— FSR mismatch).

=============================================================================
Step 4 — rnorm(b, proc): the per-reco-bin variation handed to rabbit
=============================================================================

    ratio(b)       = σ_reco(λ; b) / σ_reco(λ_central; b)
    rnorm(b, proc) = 1 + (ratio(b) − 1) · [proc is signal]   (1 in every other proc)

This is the only object that leaves the model: compute() returns rnorm(b, proc),
and rabbit multiplies the signal process's reco template (reco bin b) by it,
leaving every other process at 1. Dividing by σ_reco(λ_central) cancels the
event-count↔cross-section scale and any overall normalization, so rnorm carries
purely the SHAPE of the NP variation per reco bin — Steps 1–3 build the absolute
σ_reco(λ; b), and Step 4 reduces it to the bin-by-bin template scaling the fit
needs. σ_reco(λ_central) is precomputed once at construction as the denominator.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters and inputs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 8 v1 parameters λ (all factorisable through the current btgrid):

    γ_ν^NP (CS-side):       lambda2_nu, lambda4_nu, lambda_inf_nu
    F_eff  (TMD-effective): lambda2, lambda4, lambda6, delta_lambda2, lambda_inf

λ_central is read from the fit-tensor's metadata, where the histmaker stored
the SCETlib correction's NP runcard (see :mod:`scetlib_lambda_central`). The
np_model and np_model_nu strings are fixed at construction (from λ_central).
All λ values are TF Variables, differentiable in the fit.

=============================================================================
Getting the postfit Hessian / covariance (uncertainties on λ)
=============================================================================

The fit floats λ fine, but rabbit's postfit covariance step
``loss_val_grad_hess`` → ``t2.jacobian(grad, x)`` differentiates through the bT
fold once per fit parameter (~3754). pfor cannot see that the fold depends on
the parameters only through the ≤8 λ, so it re-materializes the internal
(Ng × Nbt) ≈ 8.75 GB bT slab for EVERY parameter → ~33 TB → OOM.

Fix (this module): a "straight-through" surrogate that keeps the exact ratio
VALUE but exposes only a compact quadratic in the ≤8 λ to autodiff:

    ratio~(λ) = stop_gradient(ratio) + J·d + ½ dᵀ K d ,   d = λ − stop_gradient(λ)

with J = dratio/dλ ([Nreco, nλ]) and K = d²ratio/dλ² ([Nreco, nλ, nλ]) computed
by forward-mode AD (≤8 / ≤64 fold passes, NOT tiled). d is identically 0 so the
value is unchanged, but ∂d/∂λ = I, so ∂ratio~/∂λ = J and ∂²ratio~/∂λ² = K:
rabbit's jacobian gets the exact derivatives while the big slab stays inside
stop_gradient and never enters the differentiated graph (33 TB → a few MB).
Implemented in ``_ratio_straightthrough`` (+ ``_ratio_compact_jac``,
``_ratio_compact_hess``); selected in ``compute()`` by env flags.

Two-pass recipe (rabbit still computes the Hessian; NO rabbit changes):

  1. Fit, no Hessian → postfit:
       rabbit_fit.py <FIT> --paramModel wremnants.postprocessing.scetlib_np.SCETlibNPParamModel <UNFOLD> <BTGRID> \
           --noHessian -o fit/

  2. Covariance at that postfit (no refit), straight-through ON:
       rabbit_fit.py <FIT> --paramModel wremnants.postprocessing.scetlib_np.SCETlibNPParamModel <UNFOLD> <BTGRID> \
           hessian_straightthrough=1 hessian_gn=1 \
           --externalPostfit fit/fitresults.hdf5 --externalPostfitResult nominal \
           --noFit -t 0 --pseudoData nominal -o cov/
     (do NOT pass --noHessian; do NOT pass --eager.) ~5 min, no OOM.
     Uncertainties are sqrt(diag(cov)) in cov/fitresults.hdf5 (results_nominal).

Switches (both OFF by default → the fit path is unchanged). They are spec
tokens inside the --paramModel spec (shown above) — the spec is stored in the
fitresults meta_info.args, so the configuration is recorded in the output
(env vars are NOT supported; all model knobs go through the spec):
  hessian_straightthrough=1  use the straight-through path in compute()
  hessian_gn=1               Gauss-Newton: keep J only, drop the K term
WARNING: hessian_straightthrough=1 WITHOUT hessian_gn=1 is full-K mode —
correct in principle (needed for real/toy data) but currently INFEASIBLE at
full grid scale (the 64 nested-FA passes unroll into one graph, ~TB peak →
OOM-kill). Until a precomputed chunked-K path is implemented, always pass
hessian_gn=1 (exact for Asimov).

GN vs full-K. The Poisson Hessian is
    H_ij = Σ_b [ (n_b/μ_b²) J_bi J_bj  +  (1 − n_b/μ_b) K_bij ].
For ASIMOV data the residual (1 − n/μ) = 0, so the K term vanishes and GN (J
only) is EXACT — drop the K term with hessian_gn=1. Real/toy data need the K
term; full-K (``_ratio_compact_hess``) matches the exact reverse-mode Hessian.
Full-K requires the ``btgrid_tf._frozen_eq_zero`` guard: the λ_inf==0 / den==0
masks compare a differentiated tensor, which makes TF's nested-forward-mode AD
raise ``IndexError`` on the ``Equal`` op; freezing the comparison input
(``tf.equal(stop_gradient(x), 0)``) drops the tangent into ``Equal`` without
changing any value or derivative (it is a measure-zero ``tf.where`` boundary).
GN remains the default for Asimov (exact and cheaper — 8 vs 72 fold passes).

WARNING: do NOT pass hessian_straightthrough=1 during the FIT. The
surrogate recomputes J(/K) on every compute() call — fine for the one-shot
covariance pass, but it would cripple the minimizer (many gradient/HVP evals).

        Usage::
            --paramModel wremnants.postprocessing.scetlib_np.SCETlibNPParamModel [key=value ...]

        Parameters
        ----------
        indata
            rabbit's input-data structure (passed by ``ph.load_models``). The
            reco×gen response matrix R (and the gen-total N_gen, axis names +
            edges) is read from ``indata.auxiliary["scetlib_np"]`` — embedded in
            the datacard by setupRabbit from a ``mz_dilepton.py --unfolding``
            histmaker output (see :func:`_R_info_from_auxiliary` and
            :mod:`response_matrix`). One source, one path: there is no file-path
            argument; R always comes from the fit input it is consistent with.
        btgrid_dir
            Directory holding the SCETlib bT-grid ``combined_btgrid.pkl``.
            Defaults (when None) to the shared data-area copy next to NanoAOD
            (``_default_btgrid_dir()``, built on the ROOT/narf-free
            ``wremnants.utilities.data_paths.getDataPath()``); pass explicitly
            at non-subMIT sites.
        lambda_central
            Dict with two sub-dicts ``eff_params`` and ``gnu_params`` (same
            shape as returned by :func:`scetlib_lambda_central.read_lambda_central`).
            By default λ_central is auto-detected from ``indata.metadata``;
            pass this only to override or to support hand-built indata that
            lacks metadata.
        signal_proc
            Name of the signal process whose reco yields get the per-bin
            ratio. Other processes get factor 1.
        Q_lo, Q_hi
            Z mass window for the Q-integration on the btgrid.
        poi_params
            Tuple of parameter names (subset of ``ALL_PARAMS``) to treat as
            POIs (reported as POIs in the fit output). The rest are reported
            as model nuisances (npou). The POI vs POU split is independent
            of the prior assignment (see ``prior_sigmas``).
        priors
            Enable Gaussian priors on the λ parameters (spec token
            ``priors=1``). Rabbit applies priors whenever a ParamModel
            *declares* ``prior_sigmas`` — there is no rabbit-side CLA (the
            old ``--paramModelPriors`` flag was dropped in WMass/rabbit#133);
            the model itself decides. This token IS that decision: only when
            set does the model declare ``prior_sigmas``. Default off →
            everything floats free.
        prior_sigmas
            Per-name override for the Gaussian prior σ on each parameter —
            a Mapping, or as spec token the comma-separated string form
            ``prior_sigmas=lambda2=0.3,delta_lambda2=nan`` (same format as
            ``xparam_default``). Defaults come from ``DEFAULT_PRIOR_SIGMAS``:

                lambda2_nu : 0.10
                lambda2    : 0.50   (symmetric approx of +0.6/-0.4)
                lambda4    : 0.50   (symmetric approx of +0.6/-0.4)

            All other params default to ``NaN`` → no prior, float free; in
            practice they are expected to be frozen with rabbit's
            ``--freezeParameters`` until the theorist provides priors for
            them. Pass ``np.nan`` here to free a constrained param, or a
            finite value to add a prior on one that defaults to NaN.
            Only meaningful together with ``priors=1``; ignored (with a
            warning) otherwise.
            Prior mean for each param is ``self.xparamdefault`` (the
            runcard's λ_central).
        nonsingular_fo_sing, nonsingular_dyturbo
            Paths to the σ_ns inputs (SCETlib singular pkl / DYTurbo
            scetlibmatch txt); default to the wremnants-data
            TheoryCorrections copies. σ_ns is always included — the matched
            σ_gen^matched(λ) = σ_gen^resum(λ) + σ_ns is what the histmaker
            nominal carries; resum-only diagnostics subtract ``sigma_ns``.
        nonsingular_qt_cutoff
            Low-qT cutoff (GeV) below which σ_ns is zeroed (the FO−singular
            difference is numerically unreliable at tiny qT).
        legacy_recon
            Use the legacy per-bin (Nbins, Nbt) reconstruction layout instead
            of the default memory-factorized one (numerically equivalent to
            ≲1e-14 rel; for parity checks only).
        xparam_default
            Comma-separated ``name=value,...`` string shifting the fit START
            (and the prior mean) off the runcard's λ_central — for closure /
            injection tests. The truth (ratio denominator) is NOT moved.
        hessian_straightthrough
            Expose compact λ-derivatives (J, optionally K) to autodiff while
            keeping the exact value — for the one-shot two-pass covariance
            recipe ONLY (see the module docstring); never set during a fit.
        hessian_gn
            With ``hessian_straightthrough``: Gauss-Newton, keep J and drop
            the K term (exact for Asimov, where the residual vanishes).
